# Usage

Now that your Cookiebot plugin has been configured, let's see how we can use it.

The Cookiebot composable has two major functionalities: the <a href="https://www.cookiebot.com/en/developer/" target="_blank">consent banner</a> and the <a href="https://www.cookiebot.com/en/manual-implementation/" target="_blank">cookie declaration</a>. Here's how you can use them:

## Consent Banner

The consent banner is the popup that appears when (first) visiting the site. It will prompt the visiter to either accept or reject cookies of choice.

To add the consent banner to your app, simply do:

::code-group
```ts [src/App.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
	// Vendor
	import { useCookiebot } from '@ambitiondev/vue-cookiebot';
	import { onMounted } from 'vue';

	// Composable
	const { consentBanner } = useCookiebot();

	onMounted(() => {
		consentBanner();
	});
</script>

<template>
	<!-- template goes here -->
</template>
```
::

## Cookie declaration

The cookie declaration generates your configured policy from the Cookiebot control center, as well as a possibility for visitors to adjust their cookie preferences. It can be used as follows:

::code-group
```ts [src/App.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
	// Vendor
	import { useCookiebot } from '@ambitiondev/vue-cookiebot';
	import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue';

	// Refs
	const cookieDeclarationRef = ref<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);

	// Composable
	const { cookieDeclaration } = useCookiebot();

	onMounted(() => {
		cookieDeclaration(consentPageRef);
	});
</script>

<template>
	<div ref="cookieDeclarationRef"></div>
</template>

```
